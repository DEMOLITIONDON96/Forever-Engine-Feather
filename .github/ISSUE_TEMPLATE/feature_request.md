**Prerequisites:**
Once again, PLEASE ensure that the feature you are requesting will benefit the Forever Engine FEATHER fork as a whole, not just a specific mod.

**Information:**
BEFORE requesting any features, keep in mind that said featue should benefit the Forever Engine FEATHER fork itself, if said requirement isn't met, the feature request will be disregarded, Any features that are suggestions for mods will not be approved. Any features that are for the sole benefit of the person requesting them will also not be accepted. Features should generally benefit everyone, and suggestions will very rarely be taken unless they are critical to maintenance of the Forever Engine FEATHER fork. Thank you.
