Characters are, usually, handled by a script.

That script contains information, such as: Animation Prefixes and Character Offsets.

The image name by default should be the same as the character's folder name.

That behavior can be overridden by using the function "setFrames" on a Character.
e.g: 
    setFrames("BOYFRIEND", "images/characters");
